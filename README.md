# Zerane C. | Student Developer Portfolio

## Introduction  
Hello! Iâ€™m Zerane C., a senior high school student from Mt. Eden with a passion for programming and technology. This year, I embarked on an exciting journey through my Computer Science Principles class, where I deepened my understanding of core programming concepts such as data types, conditional statements, operators, loops, functions, and arrays using C++ and JavaScript. As a student developer, I enjoy learning new skills and applying them to create interactive projects.

## About This Project  
This portfolio website serves as my final project for the year and showcases my growth and achievements as a budding programmer. Throughout the course, I explored various programming challenges and developed projects that helped me improve my logical thinking, coding skills, and user interface design. Building this site allowed me to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive web design techniques to present my work professionally.

## Portfolio Overview  
My portfolio site includes:
- An **About Me** section where I share my background and learning journey.
- A **Projects** section featuring interactive projects I developed during the course.
- A **Contact** section providing my email and links for professional connections.
- A clean, responsive design with smooth animations to enhance user experience.

## Featured Projects

### Hash Function  
An exploration of how hash functions work. This project demonstrates how input data (like words) can be transformed into short strings of characters using hashing, explaining the importance of this technique in computing.

### Matching Card  
A fun memory game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. This project highlights programming logic, event handling, and game design principles to create an engaging interactive experience.

### Password Generator  
An introductory JavaScript project that generates strong, random passwords to improve online security. It helped me learn about randomness, user input, and essential security concepts.
